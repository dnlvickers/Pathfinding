			Welcome to my path-finding algorithm!<br>
			You have 4 different draw modes. Press the correct key to swap modes:<br>
			-'w'   draw walls that the algorithm must solve around<br>
			-'d'   delete walls<br>
			-'s'   move the start location<br>
			-'a'   moove the end location<br><br>
			When you are done drawing, you can solve by pressing 'space'<br>
			If you need to reset the map, just press 'r'<br>		
		</p>

		<p>
			Type in the pixel size of the squares you want:<br>
			<input type="number" id="pixelSize" value="25"><br>
			Press 'r' to reset with the new pixel size.
		</p>

		<p>
			Use the slider to change the weight of the path distance.<br>
			Further to the left means the algorithm will try to solve with the least number of attempted squares.<br>
			Further to the right means it will prioritize finding the shortest path to the end, even if it takes more squares.<br>
			<input type="range" id="fWeight" value="50" min="0" max="100"><br>
